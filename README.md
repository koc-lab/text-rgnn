# Text-Relational Graph Neural Networks (Text-RGNN) for Text Classification

This repository contains the implementation of Text-Relational Graph Neural Networks (Text-RGNN) *under review in IEEE SPL* for text classification tasks. The model leverages heterogeneous graph neural networks to capture complex relationships in text data, significantly improving performance on benchmark datasets.
